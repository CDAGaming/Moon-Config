# Introduction
NightConfig is a powerful yet easy-to-use java configuration library, written in Java 8.

It supports the following formats:
- [JSON](http://www.json.org/)
- [YAML v1.1](http://yaml.org/)
- [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)
- [HOCON](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md)
